NAME
       xclimsg - send X11 client message

SYNOPSIS
       xclimsg [-mp] [-t window] [-w window] type data...

DESCRIPTION
       xclimsg sends a client message event to the X11 client controling a
       window.  It is simply an interface to XSendEvent(3)

       The first argument must be an Atom specifying the .message_type field
       of the client message event.

       The second to sixth arguments are the elements of the the .data.l[5]
       field of the client message event.  If an argument is equal to
       CurrentTime, the corresponding element of the array is set to
       CurrentTime.  If an argument is a number, the corresponding element of
       the array is set to a long.  If an argument is a window ID, the
       corresponding element of the array is set to a Window.  Otherwise, the
       argument is interpreted as an Atom.

       The format .field of the client message event is always equal to 32.
       By default, the client message event is sent to the root window.

       The options are as follows:

       -m     Call XSendEvent(3) with the event_mask argument set to
              SubstructureRedirectMask | SubstructureNotifyMask .  This may be
              used to send client messages to the window manager.

       -p     Call XSendEvent(3) with the propagate argument set to True.

       -t window
              Specifies the window the client message event is to be sent to.
              If not specified, the client message is sent to the root window.

       -w window
              Specifies the window on which the client message event was
              requested.  If not specified, the client message is requested on
              the root window.
